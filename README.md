Creative Writing is a software to train writer's creativity.
Exercise is simple: at screen left side a randomly chosen image
is shown, at right side there is a text editor to user to digit
text based on ideas suggested by image. User writes a small text,
max a paragraph, then, user clicks NEXT button to show a new
image. User continues writing text using ideas from this new
image. User repeats this step until concludes his/her work.
