        <h1>Creative Writing Program</h1>

        <p><strong>Creative Writing</strong> is a writing exercise program for
            writers that want to experiment new literary production paradigm.
            The idea to develop this software came up after creative writing
            activity performed in a Paragua&ccedil;uense Academy of Letters 
            meeting. Deck cards with different images were put on the table
            with images face down, each people randomly took five cards and
            wrote a text based on ideas suggested by card images. Creative
            Writing Software is a digital version of this exercise.
        </p>

        <h2>How it works</h2>

        <p>The interface contains two panels: right panel is a text editor in
            which user can digit, left panel displays images randomly chosen
            from image library. First, click <strong>File &Rarr; new</strong> 
            to start a new work. In dialog window, digit a name to your file or
            click <strong>BROWSER</strong> to select a directory to save your
            file in xml format. This file contains your text and used images
            list. Select image source, that is, a directory containing images
            in png or jpeg format. You can select one or more directories. Check
            <strong>Default library</strong> to use default image library stored
            in this Creative Writing Software (in this way, you need not add other
            directories as image source, although you can). Click <strong>Add</strong>
            to add other directories as image source. If you want remove an added
            directory, click this directory name, then click <strong>Remove</strong>
            button. Click <strong>OK</strong> to close dialog window and starts
            your text.</p>

        <p> A random image will be shown in left panel, write your text based on
            ideas suggested by image. You can write a word, a phrase, a paragraph
            or a larger text. Click <strong>NEXT</strong> button to display a new
            image and to continue your text. Click <strong>PREVIOUS</strong> to
            see previous images. Select <strong>File &Rarr; save</strong> to save
            your work in xml file format. To save in txt file format, click
